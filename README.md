## Adding an edition

To add an edition, add a markdown file titled "<month><year>.md" to the `_editions` directory. In the frontmatter, specify the cover photo file name, the pdf file name, and the date. See `oct2020.md` as an example. Upload the cover photo in `assets/images` and the pdf file in `assets/editions`

## FAQ

**Why is my edition cover photo too small?**

In order for edition cover photos to display well on all browsers and monitors, the images need to be sufficiently large. Try uploading an edition cover photo with a larger size.
